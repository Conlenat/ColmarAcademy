Fictional website that utilizes many techiniques and technologies in order to create a reasonable looking site.

## About the Code

### Flexbox

Positioning for the most part was done through flexbox properties and absolute positioning in order to ensure correct display on webpages.

### Google Fonts

I used the google fonts database in order to decide on fonts for the site in order to emphasize details.

### Organization

Each section is separated by a couple of lines in order to ensure that it is very easy to read and comments to differentiate each section in the code. 

### Media Queries

There are media queries in the CSS in order to ensure accurate site design on all devices up to 1440p resolutions.
